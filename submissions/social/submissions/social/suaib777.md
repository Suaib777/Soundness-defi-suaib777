# Proposal: Soundness Social Quest dApp

## Overview
Soundness Social Quest dApp is a community-driven quest platform that enables users to participate in on-chain campaigns, collect XP, and earn rewards such as tokens or NFTs.  
The main focus: connecting projects and communities in a **decentralized, transparent, and verifiable** way.

## Category
social

## Motivation
Most social/web3 campaigns today are still centralized, hard to verify, and prone to manipulation.  
By leveraging the **Soundness Layer**, quest activities can:
- Be verified with **zero-knowledge proofs**.  
- Guarantee **valid and fair** participation.  
- Provide **transparent incentives** for active community members.  

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js + WalletConnect for UI and wallet integration.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Manage quests, track progress, and distribute rewards.  
- **Soundness Layer Integration**:  
  - Verify quest completion (e.g., governance participation, on-chain transactions, or social proof).  
  - Protect user privacy via zk-proofs when submitting progress.  

## Development Timeline
- **Week 1–2**: Design smart contracts for quests + wallet integration.  
- **Week 3–4**: Integrate Soundness Layer (zk-proof validation).  
- **Week 5**: Build user-facing frontend dashboard.  
- **Week 6**: Deploy on testnet and conduct user testing.

- Integrate DAO features for community-driven governance.
